Base9 is an educational language runtime and programming language! Weâ€™re using it to show people how to use
[Eclipse OMR] to build their own language runtime with a Just in Time (JIT) Compiler! The Base9 language, b9porcelain, is a simple subset of JavaScript.

## Requirements

To get started with Base9, you'll need:

`git, build-essential, nodejs, npm, esprima, cmake, ninja`

git clone --recursive https://github.com/b9org/b9.git
cd Base9
git submodule update --init
```

## Build Base9

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
ninja
```

## Run Hello World!

Ensure you're in the build directory and run:

`./b9run/b9run ./test/hello.b9mod`

## Test Base9

You can run the full Base9 test suite with:

`ninja test`

## Build your own Language Runtime

If you'd like to build your own language runtime, you can follow our [Developer Journey] to see the steps we took in building Base9.
