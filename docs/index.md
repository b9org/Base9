# Base9 Documentation 

## Introduction to Base9

Base9 is a tiny virtual machine and programming language! Weâ€™re using it to show people how to use [Eclipse OMR] to build their own programming language. 

[Eclipse OMR]: https://github.com/eclipse/omr

The Base9 language is a subset of JavaScript and is very limited in functionality. It currently only contains support for integers. 

For a full overview of Base9 and it's components, plus a tutorial on adding new bytecodes, see our [Supercharge a Language Runtime] presentation and tutorial.
