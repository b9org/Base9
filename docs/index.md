Base9 is a tiny virtual machine and programming language! Weâ€™re using it to demonstrate how you can use [Eclipse OMR] to [build your own language runtime]. The base9 language is a subset of JavaScript with limited functionality. Visit the [about base9] page for more! For base9 set-up instructions, please visit the [set-up page]. Or, if you'd like to peruse the source code, visit our [GitHub].
