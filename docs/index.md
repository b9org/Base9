Base9 is a tiny virtual machine and programming language! Weâ€™re using it to show people how to use [Eclipse OMR] to build their own programming language. 

[Eclipse OMR]: https://www.eclipse.org/omr/

The Base9 language is a subset of JavaScript with very limited in functionality. 

For Base9 set-up instructions and a brief overview, please visit our [set-up page] or visit our [GitHub].

Have fun!
