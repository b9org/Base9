Base9 is a tiny virtual machine and programming language! Weâ€™re using it to show people how to use [Eclipse OMR] to build their own programming language. 

[Eclipse OMR]: https://www.eclipse.org/omr/

The base9 language is a subset of JavaScript with limited functionality. 

If you'd like to learn more about base9, please visit our [about base9] page.
