Base9 is a tiny virtual machine and programming language! Weâ€™re using it to demonstrate how you can use [Eclipse OMR] to [build your own language runtime]. 

[Eclipse OMR]: https://www.eclipse.org/omr/
[build your own language runtime]: ./BuildARuntime.md

The base9 language is a subset of JavaScript with limited functionality. Visit the [about base9] page for more!

[About base9]: ./AboutBase9.md

For base9 set-up instructions, please visit the [set-up page]. Or, if you'd like to peruse the source code, visit our [GitHub].
