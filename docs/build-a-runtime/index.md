Welcome to the tutorial! If you're interested in building your own [language runtime], you've come to the right place. Base9 is a miniature language runtime, and thanks to [OMR] and [JitBuilder], it even has a [Just In Time (JIT) Compiler]! The goal of this tutorial is not to teach you how to build base9, but rather to pack your arsenal full of tools to build your own language runtime. We don't want to bog down the tutorial with information you don't need, so we'll keep things straightfoward, providing useful links/definitions along the way for you to peruse at your own convenience. If you'd like to get familiar with some of the vocabulary you'll encounter, feel free to visit the [tutorial dictionary].
