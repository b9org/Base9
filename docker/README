This is the dockerfile to create a ready to run dev image for Base9
The image pulls and compiles the base OMR and Base9 source code

This is useful for running courses on using OMR or trying out example code.

To build it, run the build command in the shell script called build (sh build) 
or the docker command directly (docker build -t b9docker .).

run the docker image with "docker run -it b9docker"

If you want the initialization to run anything special, instructions, samples you can change the "go" file
